Remove the `NOT Tech Refined` label.--&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Is your enhancement request related to a problem? Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `&lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt;` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `&lt;kirby-page&gt;`, and it would render its contents within the `&lt;ion-content&gt;` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple &lt;kirby-page-top-content&gt; tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky. This is not in scope for now.\\r\\n</td>\n",

Please describe.**\\r\\nWe'd like a way to render the top of the Kirby page contents so that it visually blends with the toolbar. This includes color scheme (see #1132) as well as removing the 16px left and right margins that are applied to the rest of the contents. It is to be used for rendering the visual representation of a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\nI think we'd need a new `<kirby-page-top-content>` tag to accomplish this. It would be the (optional) first child of the `<kirby-page>`, and it would render its contents within the `<ion-content>` to make it scroll with the rest of the regular contents. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the toolbar is in dark mode (see #1132) then the top content would render using the same background and text colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\\r\\nIn some ways this is similar to a custom page title but the custom page title play together with the toolbar title in a way that this is not intended to. Still, I'm a bit undecided as to whether we need a new tag or a way to customize custom page titles.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\nAs mentioned, this is designed to work with the enhancement suggested in #1136.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be carefully considered how the UI should work if there is *both* a page title and a page top content, or if we should mark this as an error. In the same vein, we should consider if the proposed top content is conceptually overlapping with the concept of a page title or if it's a conceptually different beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial cases which we don't restrict but which we may want to flag as errors:\\r\\n- <kirby-page-top-content> not being the first child; this would render to top content anywhere but the top.\\r\\n- multiple <kirby-page-top-content> tags: this would render multiple sectipns\\r\\n\\r\\nLars Bruun has wireframes which suggest that the new section may in the future adjust dynamically to scrolling, maybe decreasing its height, then becoming sticky. This is not in scope for now.\\r\\n   \n",

       "      <td>**Describe the bug**\\r\\n\\r\\nCUDA.jl initialisation fails after suspending Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 11.2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will see an irrelevant error:\\r\\n```julia\\r\\nError: Exception while generating log record in module CUDA at \\r\\n/home/qyu/.julia/dev/CUDA/src/initialization.jl:34\\r\\n│   exception =\\r\\n│    UndefVarError: ex not defined\\r\\n│    Stacktrace:\\r\\n...\\r\\n```\\r\\nthis is described in #603 and fixed by #604 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**To reproduce**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Minimal Working Example (MWE) for this bug:\\r\\n\\r\\nLaunch Juno in Atom\\r\\n\\r\\n```julia\\r\\nusing CUDA\\r\\n\\r\\n# do some random stuff\\r\\nW = cu(rand(2, 5)) # a 2×5 CuArray\\r\\nb = cu(rand(2))\\r\\n\\r\\npredict(x) = W*x .+ b\\r\\nloss(x, y) = sum((predict(x) .- y).^2)\\r\\n\\r\\nx, y = cu(rand(5)), cu(rand(2)) # Dummy data\\r\\nloss(x, y) # ~ 3\\r\\n\\r\\n# Suspend the machine\\r\\n```\\r\\nTo suspend the machine:\\r\\n1. click the top-right of the screen \\r\\n2. click `Power Off / Log Out`\\r\\n3. click `Suspend`\\r\\n\\r\\nNow wake up the machine and the existing Julia stops working with CUDA.jl, restart Atom/Juno or just Julia in terminal, and Julia now gives `ERROR: CUDA.jl did not successfully initialize, and is not usable.` when trying to do e.g. `cu(rand(2))`.\\r\\n\\r\\n```julia\\r\\nPress Enter to start a new session.\\r\\nStarting Julia...\\r\\n               _\\r\\n   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org\\r\\n

       "25140  **Describe the bug**\\r\\n\\r\\nCUDA.jl initialisation fails after suspending Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 11.2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional context**\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will see an irrelevant error:\\r\\n```julia\\r\\nError: Exception while generating log record in module CUDA at \\r\\n/home/qyu/.julia/dev/CUDA/src/initialization.jl:34\\r\\n│   exception =\\r\\n│    UndefVarError: ex not

bug:\\r\\n\\r\\nLaunch Juno in Atom\\r\\n\\r\\n```julia\\r\\nusing CUDA\\r\\n\\r\\n# do some random stuff\\r\\nW = cu(rand(2, 5)) # a 2×5 CuArray\\r\\nb = cu(rand(2))\\r\\n\\r\\npredict(x) = W*x .+ b\\r\\nloss(x, y) = sum((predict(x) .- y).^2)\\r\\n\\r\\nx, y = cu(rand(5)), cu(rand(2)) # Dummy data\\r\\nloss(x, y) # ~ 3\\r\\n\\r\\n# Suspend the machine\\r\\n```\\r\\nTo suspend the machine:\\r\\n1. click the top-right of the screen \\r\\n2. click `Power Off / Log Out`\\r\\n3. click `Suspend`\\r\\n\\r\\nNow wake up the machine and the existing Julia stops working with CUDA.jl, restart Atom/Juno or just Julia in terminal, and Julia now gives `ERROR: CUDA.jl did not successfully initialize, and is not usable.` when trying to do e.g. `cu(rand(2))`.\\r\\n\\r\\n```julia\\r\\nPress Enter to start a new session.\\r\\nStarting Julia...\\r\\n               _\\r\\n   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org\\r\\n
